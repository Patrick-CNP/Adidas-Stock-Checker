# Adidas Stock Checker

Check stock levels for your favorite Adidas products in realtime.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the stock checker up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in order to run. You will also need npm but this is installed with nodejs.

### Installing

First you will clone or download this repository, then open your favorite text editor, mine is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Then open up the console and do the following command.

```
npm install
```

Now you will need to add your discord application bot token which you can find [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and either create a new application or use an existing one.

## Deployment

If you would like to run this 24/7 off your personal machine I would reccomend using the free credit given with google cloud, and create a server. You can make sure it runs all the time with a npm package named PM2 which will restart if errors or crashes happen.
